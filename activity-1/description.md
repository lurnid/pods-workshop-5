# W5 Workshop activity 1: Use cases for clustering

**In this workshop activity, you’ll create a list of possible use cases for clustering.**

In your group, try to think of at least three use cases for clustering. For each use case, identify:

- Why is clustering suited to this use case?
- What information is involved?
- What clusters could be identified?
